<h2>Audio File Encoder</h2>
<p><strong>Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing the entire album of music and saves them as separate audio files. </strong><br />
To do this, it uses information from the appropriate CUE file. Besides, Flacon makes it possible to conveniently revise or specify tags both for all tracks at once or for each tag separately.</p>
